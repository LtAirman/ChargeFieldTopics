# Charge Field topics on Jupyter Notebook

The goal of this project is to introduce Jupyter Notebook users to 
Charge Field physics and the Unified Field theory, etc. developed 
by Miles Mathis. See,

## The only true particles in nature are photons 

Photons are real spinning objects with mass and radii as small as 
10^(-27)m. Photons travel with both forward and angular momentum 
(e=mc^2) due to both the photon's forward and spin tangential 
motions at light speed velocities. Large numbers of traveling photons 
and resulting collisions create both electric (due to the photon's 
linear momentum) and magnetic (due to the photon's angular momentum) 
fields. 
                               
All spinning matter larger than electrons such as protons, planets, 
suns or galaxies are comprised of, and constantly recycle, photons, 
thus creating the charge field. Electrons are also comprised of 
photons however electrons are too small and energetic to allow 
proper photon recycling like larger and slower proton matter.

## Charge recycling 
                        
All protons are constantly receiving and emitting photons. Photons 
can enter a proton from any direction but usually do so at the 
proton's spin axis poles. Protons can emit photons outward in any 
direction but are usually emitted from the higher spin angular 
momentum latitudes about the proton's equator. We perceive the 
intake of charge as an apparent force of attraction, while photon 
emissions create repulsion. 
                        
## Proton bonding
                               
Protons can "bond" in one of two ways, pole-to-pole, as in the 
Helium atom, (also called an alpha) or equator-to-pole, a charge flow 
male to female connection. An electron or two will be caught in the 
streams of charge entering the proton and must orbit the proton pole, 
like "circling a drain". Neutrons too are caught in the proton charge 
stream and also orbit the proton's pole and spin axis, away from the 
proton's high emission equatorial zone.

# Atom Builder3.

AtomBuilder3 renders a 3D charge field model of the atom (1-90) 
selected by the user. 

![Periodic table](/images/atomBPT.png)
                               
The output cells contain brief markdown explanations and an
periodic table. Next the main guiwidget controls are displayed. 

Operating instructions. Start by clicking on the tenth cell, "Atom data". 
Next, from the toolbar's Cell dropdown selection menu choose "Run All Above". 
When the gui in the cell above "Atom data" becomes visible, make any changes 
to it or select an atom from the Periodic table. Next, with the gui or the 
Periodic table cell still active, select "Run All Below" from the Cell 
dropdown menu. You'll then view the main program outputs from the tab 
enclosure cell near the bottom. For any changes, repeat - go back to the 
gui or Periodic table, make changes, then select "Run All Below". 

![Slotlayout diagram](/images/slotlayout84d.png)

The next output is the Slotlayout description and diagram. The 
Slotlayout is a charge field answer to the standard periodic table.

+ All atoms can be described by the number of protons (0-6) in each 
of up to 19 slot positions. The main vertical up/down column slots
(1-7) begins with Hydrogen and Helium's center slot1 containing 1 
and 2 protons.

+ The 1-19 slot sequence order number is indicated by the left side 
number in the atomic configuration in the center and in the left 
and right side vertical columns.

+ The 2 vertical side columns' slot sequence shown is top left, then 
top right, then down one on the left, then down one on the right,
odd slot numbers on the left and even slots on the right.

+ The proton count for a given slot is indicated by the right side 
number in the center atomic configuration and side columns.

+ The X, Y or Z characters between the two numbers indicate the 
direction of the protons' equatorial emission planes viewed edgewise, 
orthogonal to the proton's spin axis.

+ Slot 1 is connected to the four front(10,14)/back(11,15) left(9,13)
/right(8,12), directions which spins as a single group called the 
Carousel. Or refer to the directions as +/-x, +/-y, and main vertical 
column +/-z.

+ Hook slot positions: 16,17,18, and 19, are joined to the main 
up/down column at slots, 2 and 3.  

+ The seven center buttons in the bottom row contains the total 
protons per slot color legend.

+ The selected atomâ€™s symbol and atomic number are in the bottom 
right corner.

Here's the charge field atomic model of Polonium for comparison. 

![Polonium, Po 84](/images/polonium84c.png)

Next, spin controls are explained and displayed. 
![19 Rotation widgets](/images/rot_widget_array.png)

Many of the larger atoms have all 19 slots occupied. Each object 
(electron, neutron or proton) within each slot spins about the spin 
axis through the slot center at the same rate, which is not correct, 
yet it still provides a good idea how the atom spins.

Eventually, all protons, neutrons and electrons should spin at their 
own rates. If a slot is unoccupied, the corresponding slot rotation 
control has nothing to spin and will not do anything. Try to remember 
to stop any active rotations before selecting another large atom or 
things will slow way down.

The rendered atom is then displayed in a tab enclosure widget. The tab
widget can also displays the atom's slotlayout (SL) diagram and a 
second SL diag. including neutrons. A fourth tab displays a second 
non-interactive periodic table with selected atom indicated; all in 
one place.

Good enough to share on GitHub. Collaborative efforts are welcome.

#### Files

* AtomBuilder.ipynb, AtomBuilder2.ipynb and mBuilder.ipynb were created 
using Jupyter Notebook 6.4.0. The code needs to import: pythreejs for 
the graphics, IPython for the display, ipywidget for the controls and 
pandas and numpy for dataframe operations.

* Cr6-Elements.csvand Cr6-Elements.json. AtomBuilder built each element's 
19 particle slots from scratch. AtomBuilder2 and mBuilder build atoms using 
the Cr6-Elements.csv dataframe. Cr6-Elements.json is not used.  

* README.md This README file was also written with Jupyter notebook.

* .ipynb_checkpoints folder. As I understand it. The .ipynb_checkpoints 
folder/directory amounts to a temporary backup file generated by the
Notebook user's manual save commands, allowing the user to revert to 
the previous saved command. Its included in the gitignore file. 

* .gitignore. Containing only .ipynb_checkpoints and sub directories.

* images folder. The folder contains six png files, screen captures of 
output generated by the code: Helium2, chromium24, slotlayout84, polonium84, 
atomBPT, and rot_widget_array.png, all of which are used in this readme file.

* LICENSE.txt. Added an MIT License for the ChargeFieldTopics repository
on 29 May 2022.

This project was Cr6's idea. He's also responsible for following Miles 
Mathis' atomic model and creating the Slotlayout diagram on which this 
project greatly relies.

There's at least one 10 year old charge field javaScript "Atom Viewer" 
out there, Nevyn's object oriented, way sophisticated javaScript code. 
I guess I'm ready to try and figure it out. 

Please pardon my understandings, personal interpretations and mistakes.
