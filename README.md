# Charge field topics for Jupyter Notebook
***
This project is intended to introduce Charge field and Unified Field 
theory developed by Miles Mathis. All matter is comprised of and is 
constantly recycling real, spinning photons with radii as small 
as 10^(-27)m. Reference,

## Atom Builder. Written for Jupyter Notebook 6.4.0, importing:
#### pythreejs graphics, IPython display and ipywidget controls. 
***
"SECTION 9: THE NUCLEUS" of the above reference contains descriptions 
and diagrams of charge channeling and charge recycling by the elements. 
The Atom Builder is a Jupyter Notebook file which creates the atomic 
element selected by the user. See, 'How to Build the Elements'.
