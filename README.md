# Charge Field topics on Jupyter Notebook

The goal of this project is to introduce Jupyter Notebook users to 
Charge Field physics and the Unified Field theory, etc. developed 
by Miles Mathis. See,
***THE GREATEST STANDING ERRORS IN PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS***

The only true particles in nature are photons, real spinning 
objects with mass and radii as small as 10^(-27)m. Photons travel 
with both forward and angular momentum (c^2) due to both the 
photon's forward and spin tangential light speed velocities, i.e. 
real spinning photons create both electric (linear photon momentum) 
and magnetic (angular photon momentum) fields. All matter larger 
than photons such as electrons, protons, planets, suns or galaxies 
are comprised of and constantly recycle photons, creating the 
charge field.

# Atom Builder.

The Atom Builder (AB). There's at least one 10 year old javascript 
charge field "Atom Viewer" out there, nut this is, as far as I know, 
the first Charge field based topic intended for Jupyter Notebook. 
It creates 
a 3D model of the atomic element (1-90) selected by the user. My 
coding ability as well as AB is still new and needs plenty of work. 

![Periodic table](/images/atomBPT.png)
Atom Builder includes an ipywidget gridspec Periodic Table button 
layout which can be used to select the desired atom.

Run each cell in turn. The ninth cell (currently) makes the widget 
controls visible, the tenth cell displays the periodic table. 
Running the 11th cell displays a second copy of the widget controls 
below the periodic table. More than one instance of a widget can 
be open at the same time, allowing widgets to be as convenient as 
possible, the widgets all track observed changes simultaneously. 

Select the desired atom with a button or drop-down widget. Other 
control options include: type of proton emissions displayed, color 
coding of the specific number of protons in each proton stack, 
proton separation distances, and whether to include an atomic label 
or not. Then run that cell and the following cells, allowing time 
for the atom to build, till the till the atom becomes visible.

After the atom come 18 separate slot rotation control widgets, 
this needs to be consolidated. Each slot may contain a neutron 
or a proton, or both, or a single stack of up to 6 protons, 6 
neutrons and 6 electrons. Each atom has up to 19 occupied slots
and only a few of the larger atoms have all 19 slots occupied. 
Each object within each slot spins about the an axis through the
slot center at the same rate, which is not correct, yet it 
provides a good idea how the atom spins. Eventually, all protons, 
neutrons and electrons should spin at their own rates.

The first rotation control, grpAn, spins the 'Carousel', which 
includes the front/back and left/right objects (neutrons or 
protons, etc) connected to the center slot but not in the up/down 
directions on the atom's main vertical column. The output 
displays the up/down atomic dimension sideways to save space, 
the orbital camera allows views from most angles. The rest of 
the rotation controls spin each of the slots. If a slot is 
unoccupied, the corresponding slot rotation control has 
nothing to spin and will not work erroring just that slot control. 

Running the two cells after the 19 rotation controls creates the 
atom's **Slotlayout diagram**.
![Slotlayout table](/images/slotlayout84.png)
All atoms can be described by the number of protons (0-6) in each 
of up to 19 slot positions. The main vertical up/down column slots
(1-7) begins with Hydrogen and Helium at the center (1, and 2). 
Atoms also grow in the four left(9,13)/right(8,12) and 
front(10,14)/back(11,15) directions, or call them +/-x.+/-y,+/-z. 
The so-called hook slot positions: 16,17,18, and 19, are joined to 
the the main up/down column slots, 2 and 3. The atom is identified 
in the bottom righthand corner. 

Good enough to share on GitHub. Collaborative efforts are welcome.  

The reference's **SECTION 9: THE NUCLEUS** contains descriptions
and diagrams of charge channeling and charge recycling by the 
elements. A paper most relevant to Atom Builder is 
>**How to Build the Elements**.

#### Files

* AtomBuilder.ipynb was created using Jupyter Notebook 6.4.0.
The code needs to import: pythreejs for the graphics, IPython
for the display and ipywidget for the controls.

* README.md This README file was also written with Jupyter notebook.

* .ipynb_checkpoints folder. As I understand it. The .ipynb_checkpoints 
folder/directory amounts to a temporary backup file generated by the
Notebook user's manual save commands, allowing the user to revert to 
the previous saved command. Its included in the gitignore file. 

* .gitignore. Containing only .ipynb_checkpoints and sub directories.

* images folder. The folder contains two png files: Helium2, chromium24, 
slotlayout84 an atomBPT, all of which are used in this readme file.

* LICENSE.txt, As soon as possible, 
>"This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license."

Miles Mathis' Charge Field ideas are free. This project is 
intended to be a Public Domain free and open source, Jupyter 
Notebook application example
https://jupyter.org/
developed from graphics examples found at pythreejs  
https://pythreejs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/index.html
and widgets found at
https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Basics.html
following Miles Mathis' ideas.

This was Cr6's idea. Please pardon my interpretations, etc. 
I'm still new at this, plenty of mistakes to call my own.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an 
issue first to discuss what you'd like to change.
