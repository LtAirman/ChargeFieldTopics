# Charge Field topics on Jupyter Notebook

The goal of this project is to introduce Jupyter Notebook users to 
Charge Field physics and the Unified Field theory, etc. developed 
by Miles Mathis. See,
***THE GREATEST STANDING ERRORS IN PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS***

[Miles Mathis science site Homepage](http://milesmathis.com/index.html).

The only true particles in nature are photons, real spinning 
objects with mass and radii as small as 10^(-27)m. Photons travel 
with both forward and angular momentum (c^2) due to both the 
photon's forward and spin tangential light speed velocities, i.e. 
real spinning photons create both electric (linear photon momentum) 
and magnetic (angular photon momentum) fields. All matter larger 
than photons such as electrons, protons, planets, suns or galaxies 
are comprised of and constantly recycle photons, creating the 
charge field.

# Atom Builder.

Atom Builder (AB). There's at least one 10 year old javascript 
charge field "Atom Viewer" out there; Nevyn's object oriented, way 
too sophisticated for me to understand script. This project may be 
the first Charge field based topic intended for Jupyter Notebook. 
It creates a 3D charge field model of the atom (1-90) selected by 
the user. Please pardon this first project, it needs work. 

![Periodic table](/images/atomBPT.png)
Atom Builder includes an ipywidget gridspec **Periodic Table**
button layout which can be used to select the desired atom.

Run each cell in turn. The ninth cell (currently) makes the widget 
controls visible, the tenth cell displays the periodic table. 
Running the 11th cell displays a second copy of the widget controls 
below the periodic table. More than one instance of a widget can 
be open at the same time, allowing widgets to be as convenient as 
possible, the widgets all track observed changes simultaneously. 

Select the desired atom with either a button or drop-down widget. 
Other control options include: type of proton emissions displayed, 
color coding of the specific number of protons in each proton stack, 
proton separation distances, and whether to include an atomic label 
or not. 

Then run that cell and the following cells, allowing time for the 
atom to build, till the atom is rendered.

The cell just before the atom is displayed creates the first 
rotation control, grpAn, which spins the 'Carousel', the front/back 
and left/right objects (neutrons or protons, etc) connected to the 
center of the atom's main column. The main column is shown sideways 
to save space. 

The 18 cells following the rendered atom contain rotation controls 
for each of the remaining slots. Each atom has up to 19 occupied 
slots and only a few of the larger atoms have all 19 slots occupied 
- there's more on slots and the Slotlayout diagram below. Each object 
within each slot spins about the an axis through the slot center at 
the same rate, which is not correct, yet it still provides a good 
idea how the atom spins. Eventually, all protons, neutrons and 
electrons should spin at their own rates. If a slot is unoccupied, 
the corresponding slot rotation control has nothing to spin and will
not work erroring just that slot control. 

Running the two cells after the 18 rotation controls creates the 
atom's **Slotlayout diagram**.
![Slotlayout diagram](/images/slotlayout84b.png)
All atoms can be described by the number of protons (0-6) in each 
of up to 19 slot positions. The main vertical up/down column slots
(1-7) begins with Hydrogen and Helium at the center (1 and 2). 
Atoms also grow in the four left(9,13)/right(8,12) and 
front(10,14)/back(11,15) directions, or call them +/-x.+/-y, with 
main vertical column +/-z. Hook slot positions: 16,17,18, and 19, 
are joined to the main up/down column slots, 2 and 3. The atom is 
identified in the bottom righthand corner. Here's the image of 
Polonium for comparison.

Good enough to share on GitHub. Collaborative efforts are welcome.  

The reference's **SECTION 9: THE NUCLEUS** contains descriptions
and diagrams of charge channeling and charge recycling by the 
elements. A paper most relevant to Atom Builder is 
>**How to Build the Elements**. 
>Explaining the periodic table, with nuclear diagrams".

#### Files

* AtomBuilder.ipynb was created using Jupyter Notebook 6.4.0.
The code needs to import: pythreejs for the graphics, IPython
for the display and ipywidget for the controls.

* README.md This README file was also written with Jupyter notebook.

* .ipynb_checkpoints folder. As I understand it. The .ipynb_checkpoints 
folder/directory amounts to a temporary backup file generated by the
Notebook user's manual save commands, allowing the user to revert to 
the previous saved command. Its included in the gitignore file. 

* .gitignore. Containing only .ipynb_checkpoints and sub directories.

* images folder. The folder contains two png files: Helium2, chromium24, 
slotlayout84 an atomBPT, all of which are used in this readme file.

* LICENSE.txt, As soon as possible, 
>"This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license."

Miles Mathis' Charge Field ideas are free. This project is 
intended to be a Public Domain free and open source, Jupyter 
Notebook application example
https://jupyter.org/
developed from graphics examples found at pythreejs  
https://pythreejs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/index.html
and widgets found at
https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Basics.html
following Miles Mathis' ideas.

This was Cr6's idea. Please pardon my interpretations, etc. 
I'm still new at this, plenty of mistakes to call my own.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an 
issue first to discuss what you'd like to change.
